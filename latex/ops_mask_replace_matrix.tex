Finally, the set of output values that make up matrix $\matrix{\widetilde{Z}}$ 
are written into the final result matrix {\sf C}, using what is called
a \emph{standard matrix mask and replace}. 
This is carried out under control of the mask which acts as a ``write mask''.
\begin{itemize}
\item If {\sf desc[GrB\_OUTP].GrB\_REPLACE} is set, then any values in {\sf C} on
input to this operation are deleted and the content of the new output matrix,
{\sf C}, is defined as,
\[
\bold{L}({\sf C}) = \{(i,j,Z_{ij}) : (i,j) \in (\bold{ind}(\matrix{\widetilde{Z}}) 
\cap \bold{ind}(\matrix{\widetilde{M}})) \}. 
\]

\item If {\sf desc[GrB\_OUTP].GrB\_REPLACE} is not set, the elements of 
$\matrix{\widetilde{Z}}$ indicated by the mask are copied into the result 
matrix, {\sf C}, and elements of {\sf C} that fall outside the set 
indicated by the mask are unchanged:
\[
\bold{L}({\sf C}) = \{(i,j,C_{ij}) : (i,j) \in (\bold{ind}({\sf C}) 
\cap \bold{ind}(\neg \matrix{\widetilde{M}})) \} \cup \{(i,j,Z_{ij}) : (i,j) \in 
(\bold{ind}(\matrix{\widetilde{Z}}) \cap \bold{ind}(\matrix{\widetilde{M}})) \}.
\]
\end{itemize}

In {\sf GrB\_BLOCKING} mode, the method exits with return value 
{\sf GrB\_SUCCESS} and the new content of matrix {\sf C} is as defined above
and fully computed.
In {\sf GrB\_NONBLOCKING} mode, the method exits with return value 
{\sf GrB\_SUCCESS} and the new content of matrix {\sf C} is as defined above
but may not be fully computed. However, it can be used in the next GraphBLAS 
method call in a sequence.
