Finally, the set of output values that make up vector $\vector{\widetilde{z}}$ 
are written into the final result vector {\sf w}, using
what is called a \emph{standard vector mask and replace}. 
This is carried out under control of the mask which acts as a ``write mask''.
\begin{itemize}
\item If {\sf desc[GrB\_OUTP].GrB\_REPLACE} is set, then any values in {\sf w} 
on input to this operation are deleted and the content of the new output vector,
{\sf w}, is defined as,
\[ 
\bold{L}({\sf w}) = \{(i,z_{i}) : i \in (\bold{ind}(\vector{\widetilde{z}}) 
\cap \bold{ind}(\vector{\widetilde{m}})) \}. 
\]

\item If {\sf desc[GrB\_OUTP].GrB\_REPLACE} is not set, the elements of 
$\vector{\widetilde{z}}$ indicated by the mask are copied into the result 
vector, {\sf w}, and elements of {\sf w} that fall outside the set indicated by 
the mask are unchanged:
\[ 
\bold{L}({\sf w}) = \{(i,w_{i}) : i \in (\bold{ind}({\sf w}) 
\cap \bold{ind}(\neg \vector{\widetilde{m}})) \} \cup \{(i,z_{i}) : i \in 
(\bold{ind}(\vector{\widetilde{z}}) \cap \bold{ind}(\vector{\widetilde{m}})) \}. 
\]
\end{itemize}

In {\sf GrB\_BLOCKING} mode, the method exits with return value 
{\sf GrB\_SUCCESS} and the new content of vector {\sf w} is as defined above
and fully computed.  
In {\sf GrB\_NONBLOCKING} mode, the method exits with return value 
{\sf GrB\_SUCCESS} and the new content of vector {\sf w} is as defined above 
but may not be fully computed. However, it can be used in the next GraphBLAS 
method call in a sequence.
