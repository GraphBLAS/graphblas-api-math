# GraphBLAS Math Specification

The GraphBLAS Math Specification lays out, in a computer language-independent format, the mathematics that
needs to be carried out to implement the operations that must be included in all GraphBLAS APIs.  The initial contents is being pulled from the C API Specification and merged with the contents of the paper "The Mathematical Foundations of the GraphBLAS."

TODO: incorporate the mathematical notation of GraphBLAS that has evolved over the years (in the LAGraph-Working-Group repo).

## Example: Breadth-first traversal (compute level/ply of each node)
